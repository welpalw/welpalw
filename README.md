- 👋 Hi, I’m Addison Welp.  I'm a high school French and English teacher in Northern Kentucky/Greater Cincinnati area, and I also run my own small travel business that focuses on family and destination travel.  I will be retiring from the classroom this year and I'm learning new skills to help me transition into a new career.
- 👀 I’m interested in a career in instructional design or UX design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding and web development through the Code:You program based in Louisville, KY. I am also working on Google UX Design certification. My first goal is to use my knowledge to build my own travel business website and to build a professional portfolio website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects for beginners that might relate to education, training & development, or travel.

- ⚡ Fun facts: I love vacationing at Walt Disney World; I have visited over a dozen times in the past 10 years!  Also, I am a collector of all things owl-themed.  In fact, one of my Christmas trees is decorated with over 350 owl ornaments!
